# Dynamic programming

## Notes
### Make it work.
    - break the main problem into many sub-problems recursivly
    - visualize the problem as a tree
    - implement the tree using recursion
    - test it

### Make it efficient
    - add a memo object 
    - add a base case to return memo values
    - store retuen values into the memo
