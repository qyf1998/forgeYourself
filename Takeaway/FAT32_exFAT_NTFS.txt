NT File System (NTFS)
- NTFS is the modern file system Windows likes to use by default.
- NTFS has file and partition size limits that are so theoretically huge you wonâ€™t run up against them.
- It only works on Windows machines. On Mac OS, only read, can't write.


Extended File Allocation Table (exFAT)
- designed to be a lightweight file system like FAT32
- full readable and writeable in Windows and Mac
- mostly used on USB drives. 


Allocation Unit Size:
- e.g.
    - unit size of 1 Mb
    - actual file size : 1 kb
    - size of file on disk: 1 MB

- small size
    - save space, low transfer speed

- big size
    - require more space, but higher transfer speed
